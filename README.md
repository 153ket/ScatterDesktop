## Open Beta Rules

There are some safety rules right now while Scatter Desktop is in open-beta. Though the same security 
measures done on the chrome extension were taken it is always best not to use expose large quantities of funds 
to software that has not been tested by large numbers yet.

- **Use fresh keypairs and accounts**. Do not use accounts with keys linked to other accounts.
- **Do not send large amounts of funds** to the addresses or accounts you are using in Scatter Desktop.
